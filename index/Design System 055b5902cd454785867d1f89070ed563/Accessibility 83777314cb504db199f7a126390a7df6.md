Accessibility should be included in the scope of everything we create at Acme Corp.
These guidelines outline our minimum requirements.

# Color

- Never rely exclusively on color to convey information.
- The contrast between text and background color should be at minimum 4.5 to 1.

# Forms

- Design around native browser elements whenever possible.
- Design focus states for fields and buttons. This improves keyboard navigation.
- Clearly label all fields. Never hide labels.

# Multimedia

- Always provide alt text for images / non-text content.
- Videos should always include closed captions.

# Document Structure

- Follow established design patterns whenever possible.
- Documents should establish clear hierarchy using H1, H2, H3 etc.
