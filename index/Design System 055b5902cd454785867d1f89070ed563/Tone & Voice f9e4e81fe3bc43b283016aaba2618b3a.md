This is sample content that you can replace with your own.

At Acme Corp, we always speak in a way that reflects our brand and values. The words we choose always put our users first, helping them better understand, navigate, and find value in our products.

# ðŸš© Guiding Principles

Following these principles will help us write with purpose.

### Simple

Simple words and sentences are always preferred. Edit ruthlessly.

### Human

We should speak **with** our users instead of **at** them. Warm and relatable is always better than corporate and cold.

### Considered

Always consider the user. What is most helpful? What is most relevant?

### Contextual

Always take context into account. Adjust tone to match **who** you're writing for and **what** you're writing about.

# ðŸŽ¨ UI Guidelines

Thoughtful UI writing adds context to visual interfaces.

### Headings & Subheadings

- Headings and subheadings help structure content.
- Always use title case.
- No punctuation unless the title is a question.
- A page should only have one heading (H1).
- Use subheadings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to make content more scannable.
- Headings should follow a natural hierarchy. An H3 should be nested under an H2.
- Relevant keywords should be included in headings, but SEO should not be the only factor considered when writing. We should speak like humans.

### Navigation

- Always use title case.
- Clarity is key. Avoid ambiguous marketing-speak.

### Buttons

- Always include an action.
- Capitalize every word.
- Always be clear and concise.

### Numbered Lists

- Use for steps and sets of relevant information.
- Use punctuation if one of the list items is a complete sentence.
- Number lists when order is important (instructions, sequential processes).

### Links

- Include a link whenever referencing external content.
- Avoid phrases like "click here." Instead, use language that describes the content you're linking to. For example: download our catalog.

### Forms

- Labels should be clear and concise.
- Use title case for form **titles**.
- Use sentence case for form **fields**.

### Alt Text

- Every image should have alt text.
- Alt text briefly describes an image in one or two sentences.

### SEO

- Write for our audience, not for Google.
- Use headings to appropriately structure content in a logical, parseable way.
- Every image should have alt text.

# ðŸ““ Grammar

Proper grammar promotes clarity and helps us speak in a professional voice.

### Contractions

- Contractions are encouraged. They add a friendly, informal tone.

### Active Voice

- Always use [active voice](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/active_and_passive_voice/active_versus_passive_voice.html) over passive voice.

### Emoji

- We love emoji!
- The occasional emoji can help convey emotion and add visual interest.
- Use emojis tastefully and in moderation.

### Slang & Terminology

- Avoid slang. Write in plain English.
- Technical terms should always be accompanied by a clear definition.

### Acronyms

- Always spell out acronyms word-for-word the first time they're used.
- First use: Automatic Teller Machine
- Second use: ATM
- No need for a parenthetical.
